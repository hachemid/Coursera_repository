INTRODUCTION/ BUSINESS PROBLEM:

I choosed the second proposition wich says :
In a city of Toronto, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it?
I've choosed this one beacause I think it is a good idea to apply both what we did in weeks 2 and 3.
In week 2 we've learned how to use the Foursquare API which allows us to search and explore a given place
or venue in order to get all the information we want about it, thus it is good start to know if this location will be
benefecial for our client to open his restaurant. Secondly, in week 3 we have created our dataframe from the wikipedia page
about the different neighbourhoods with their locations, as a result, we're going to use these information in our foursquare API
for exploring neighbourhoods.
